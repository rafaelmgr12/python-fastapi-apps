# FastAPI with backgrounds jobs

To start an discussion about any subject it is important to state the definition. In this case we have the **backgrounds** jobs. It follows:

> Background jobs(tasks) run asynchronously and do not block the main application flow.

As the definitoin state, we can have some clue about what is it. Theses tasks are useful for operaetions that take time but can be completne aftewr a while, uscha as sending emails, processing large files, or making API calls to third-party services.

This tecniquei are not exslucseve for python, but all web framerkows have some wayt tom implente this. in this example, we focuos on the python implemention using `FastAPI`. So we have a the following code, that make an example of how to send an email.

```python

from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks

app = FastAPI()

def send_welcome_message(message: str):
    """
      sending to particular user
    """
    pass


@app.post("/send-email/")
async def UserRegistration(background_tasks: BackgroundTasks, email: str):
    """
      write here you user registration logic
    """
    if user_created_successfully:
        background_tasks.add_task(send_welcome_message, f"Email sent to: {email}")
    return {"message": "User Registration is completed"}

```

## Why Use Background Tasks in FastAPI?

Using background tasks in FastAPI is beneficial for several reasons:

1. **User Experience**: Background tasks allow operations that could delay the main application flow to run asynchronously. For example, sending a welcome email during user registration can be deferred to a background task. This ensures that the user registration process is quick and does not make the user wait for the email to be sent.

2. **Scalability**: As applications grow and handle more users, performing time-consuming operations in the main application flow can become a bottleneck. Background tasks help by offloading these operations, allowing the main application to handle more requests concurrently.

3. **Asynchronous Processing**: FastAPI's background tasks enable asynchronous processing of operations that do not require immediate feedback. For instance, if the task involves sending data to a third-party service or processing large files, these can be handled in the background, freeing up resources for other tasks.

4. **Resource Management**: By utilizing background tasks, the main application thread is freed from resource-intensive operations, allowing it to efficiently manage and respond to incoming requests.

## When to Avoid Using Background Tasks?

While background tasks are powerful, there are scenarios where they may not be suitable:

- **Critical Operations**: If the task is critical and must be executed immediately, like sending a one-time password (OTP) for user verification, background tasks may not be the best option. Such operations require instant feedback to the user, and delays can result in a poor user experience.

- **Synchronous Requirements**: Some tasks may have dependencies that require them to be executed synchronously with other operations. In these cases, background tasks might lead to issues if the tasks are processed out of order or too late.

## Comparison with Celery

FastAPI's background tasks are a simple and effective solution for many use cases, but for more complex requirements, you might consider using Celery:

| Feature          | FastAPI Background Tasks            | Celery                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Simplicity**   | Simple and easy to use              | More complex to set up          |
| **Dependencies** | No additional dependencies required | Requires RabbitMQ, Redis, etc.  |
| **Scalability**  | Suitable for smaller applications   | Highly scalable for large-scale |
| **Use Cases**    | Simple background tasks             | Complex and long-running tasks  |

Celery is a robust, flexible, and distributed task queue system for handling background tasks in Python. It supports more complex workflows and is highly scalable, making it ideal for larger applications that require distributed task management.
